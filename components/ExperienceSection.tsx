      "Developing predictive ML models using 50,000+ satellite and glider samples at Rutgers Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab (RAD), implementing 9+ algorithms including ResNet, CNN, XGBoost to optimize F1 score and ROC-AUC for marine mammal detection. Engineered comprehensive ML pipeline using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn with stratified sampling, SMOTE oversampling, and 10-fold cross-validation to handle imbalanced datasets and spatial autocorrelation challenges. Designed statistical models incorporating 10+ oceanographic variables (depth, salinity, temperature, chlorophyll-a, SST) to assess biodiversity-economic tradeoffs using satellite and autonomous glider sensor data. Reviewing academic papers weekly to enhance model architecture and ecological understanding, adding 2+ variables to current dataset and performing preprocessing on 42,000 raw samples with strategic missing data imputation",
